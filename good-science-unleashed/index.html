        It is early August 2023 as I build this expandable panel project, and my
        attention has been firmly captured by The Korean Institute of Science
        and Technology’s paper on the first room-temperature ambient-pressure
        superconductor, LK-99. All these developments, the excitement, the
        energy, and the skepticism, have had me turning over in my head the many
        transformative possibilities of future technology. Regardless of how
        this plays out, it is infinitely interesting to think about positive
        things that aren’t. It is captivating to imagine what we can do in order
        to nurture humanity and the world. We can do so much harm, but we can
        also heal, in ways little and big. The following are some very real
        possibilities that would be simply world-changing.

        <p>
          A portable and affordable water purification technology could
          transform contaminated water into safe drinking water. This innovation
          could address water scarcity issues, prevent waterborne diseases, and
          improve the health and well-being of communities around the globe.
          Desalination methods and more efficient sanitation could ensure clean
          and accessible drinking water for all, addressing a critical global
          issue.

          A combination of precision farming techniques, drought-resistant
          crops, and vertical farming technologies could further revolutionize
          food production, especially in areas of the world that need this the
          most. This could enhance global food security, minimize environmental
          impact, and ensure nutritious food availability for all, contributing
          to the eradication of hunger. Innovations in agricultural techniques
          and alternative protein sources could enhance food security and reduce
          the environmental impact of farming.
